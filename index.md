### Workshop Description
Cyber-crimes against critical infrastructure, operational technology, IoT, and large organizations have become more complex and hybridized and are executed at machine speed. In response to that, cyber defenders’ transition from manual and reactive approaches to more automated and proactive. A key element for building a robust security posture against adversarial attacks is Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI). CTI allows security teams to benefit from increased situational awareness and thus minimize their organizations' attack surfaces. Based on the detection maturity of an organization, such intelligence can update cyber defense components in an automated manner based on the established trust between the entity sharing the intelligence and the entity consuming it, or in more proactive approaches such as threat hunting and risk assessment. For example, TTPs used in adversarial activities can support threat hunting efforts where the objective is to detect unidentified malicious activity that evaded existing security solutions. The CyberHunt workshop aims to present AI-focused (e.g., symbolic AI, machine learning, NLP) research in the areas of cyber-threat hunting, cyber-threat intelligence, and security orchestration, automation, and response.

### Research Topics
The workshop welcomes research in the following areas.

* Cyber Threat Intelligence
* Models for forecasting cyber-attacks and measuring impact
*	Threat actor groups & techniques
*	Semantic modeling, data representation and fusion for CTI
*	Models that take into consideration Deception and Uncertainty in cyber-attack attribution
*	Indicators of compromise and behavior and how to detect/mitigate
*	Visualization techniques for intelligence analysis and investigation
*	Legal, privacy and ethical factors in intelligence analysis
*	Data analytics for security
*	Threat Hunting
*	Intrusion and anomaly detection and prevention
*	Incident Response
*	Monetization of cybercrime
*	Open source cybersecurity tools
*	Relevant geopolitical cybersecurity research
*	Security Automation and Orchestration
